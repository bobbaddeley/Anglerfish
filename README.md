# Anglerfish
Anglerfish for Bikes is a project to help people locate their bicycles at night. It uses Bluetooth Low Energy, so you can use either the remote or your smartphone. Simply press the button and the globe on your bike will light up with your customized pattern, letting you know where your bike is.

## Current Status - 2015/08/17

This project is currently at Working Prototype status. The firmware works, the electronics work, the mechanicals work, and in practice it works. There are still a lot of things necessary to turn this from a project to a product. A lot of refinement and cleaning to make the parts easier to assemble, more robust (especially the transmitter), and making it easier to install.

Here's a video of the status, plus it working in a practical situation. Woo! There won't be any additional development until after Burning Man, when I can learn from it in a real environment and figure out what needs to be refined.

## Licenses

Because we use a module, we should be ok with the FCC. The other circuitry may still need to be tested for unintentional transmission, but it's extremely unlikely that it would cause any problems.

Use of the Bluetooth logo is limited, and I think even using the word may be a problem with the Bluetooth SIG. If this project ever seeks commercialization, we'll have to deal with that.

I haven't looked into the use of the Anglerfish name for trademarks, and I haven't looked to see if this idea violates any patents.

I am not using any proprietary or restricted code.
